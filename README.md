# Munch-Da-Burger

### Description
```
Munch-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be munched!.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Munch!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether 'Munched!' or not.
